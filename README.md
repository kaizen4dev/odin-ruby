# Mastermind

Solution for Mastermind project in ruby course of The Odin Project curriculum.

Dependencies: 
- any nerd font - game uses some icons
- colozire(included in gemfile)

To play run `bundle exec ruby main.rb` after cloning this branch.
To clone this particular branch use: `git clone -b mastermind git@github.com:kaizen4dev/odin-ruby.git`

## Features
Checked features already implemented, rest are planned.

- guess mode - done
- mastermind mode - lacking proper algorithm for bot to guess the code
- posibility to save statistics - idea abandoned

P.S. I'm so sick of looking at Mastermind board.. I hate testing.
